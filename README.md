# foodee

Foodee is a clever django powered website that helps managing customers and also the restaurant to track orders. Customers can create an account and manage their orders and also explore different dishes of the restaurant. There is also a blog published by the chefs of the restaurant. You can like a dish and put it into your favourite dishes. You can also read and comment on the blog just like any other food blog. You can be a premium customer by ordering in our restaurant more than 10 times. 
To stay tuned for new updates about dishes and new posts in our blog, you can subscribe to our RSS feed!
